# Data Analysis Project: Regression, Classification, and Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive data analysis techniques including linear regression, multi-class classification, and sentiment analysis using Python. The analyses are performed on the Iris dataset and a text sentiment dataset, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Components

### 1. Linear Regression Analysis on Iris Dataset
- Predicts petal length and sepal length based on other botanical features.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Builds and evaluates linear regression models using metrics such as R-squared (RÂ²), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Visualizes model performance and feature importance.

### 2. Classification of Iris Species
- Implements multiple classification algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
- Conducts data preprocessing including label encoding and feature scaling.
- Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Performs hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search to optimize model performance.
- Visualizes classification results and feature importance.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis on Text Data
- Applies lexicon-based sentiment analysis using TextBlob.
- Preprocesses text data through normalization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Classifies sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral categories.
- Visualizes sentiment distribution and generates word clouds for each sentiment class.
